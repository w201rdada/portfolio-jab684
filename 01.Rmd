## A beginning.

All businesses seek to better serve current clients and to grow their client base. However, the latter goal requires an enormous amount of resources. The time and money spent researching and pitching potential clients and then incorporating new clients can add up quickly, and this can detract from improving services offered to current clients. One way to minimize resources spent on business development and better serve current clients is to increase retention of current clients.

## A middle.

I propose a two-pronged solution to improve client retention rates. First, you must accurately identify which prospective clients are most likely to remain over time. Second, it is important to closely monitor current client characteristics and interactions to determine if they may become at risk of leaving. 

To solve the first problem, I determine the characteristics of a loyal customer using data science techniques applied to data about your current client base. An exploratory data analysis will reveal characteristics worth investigating further. 

Once we have determined these characteristics, I develop a tool that allows the user (such as a sales manager) to input characteristics of potential clients to predict their likelihood of being a loyal client. This tool can be used early in the business development process to better target potential clients. 

The second part of this solution will depend on data about former clients. Similar techniques will reveal key indicators of client termination that can be used to categorize current clients into tiers based on their likelihood to terminate. This allows you to quickly identify ‘high risk’ clients and appropriately divert resources to ensure that they remain.  

## An end.

Resources are limited even at the largest companies, so all business should strive to use their own resources in the most efficient way. This solution can dramatically increase client retention, decreasing spending on business development by thousands of dollars per year and freeing up current employees to focus on providing better services to current clients who will remain longer. This solution will become more effective over time as trends emerge within current and past clients, so data collection and analysis should continue to be a focus of your organization. 

It is important to note that this solution will not promise client retention of 100%, as there may be extenuating circumstances that affect whether a client remains. However, this will capture many of your more ‘typical’ clients and allow you to refocus resources on anomalies if they arise. Additionally, this solution must be also paired with a continued focus on growing your client base and providing the best client services possible.
