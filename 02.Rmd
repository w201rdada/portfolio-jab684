## The beginning.
Fundraising is often the key to survival for non-profit organizations, particularly universities. As support from the federal, state, and local government looks bleak in the near future, many non-profits are refocusing efforts on individual giving. As need for funding increases, resources to achieve it stay stagnant or even decreases. Therefore, the ultimate goal of a fundraising or development team should always be to find the perfect balance of minimizing cost to fundraise (personnel, venues, food, goods, etc.) while increasing giving (amount, frequency, and reach). 

Achieving this lofty goal requires a sophisticated approach to optimizing marketing and outreach campaigns. Luckily, universities collect a lot of data on donors – which is increasingly easier in this day and age – but most don’t know what to do with it. This is where we come in – we can help your university better utilize donor data to increase fundraising capabilities while decreasing cost.


## The middle.
The primary question your development office seeks to answer is: How can we optimize fundraising efforts? Our software tool, FUNdraiser, can help. We input data that you are already gathering about donor (and potential donor) demographic information; giving history; and engagement with email campaigns, LinkedIn, Facebook, and in-person events. FUNdraiser uses all of this to build a predictive model for a particular donor’s (or group of donors) likelihood to give, which can be tailored depending on the goal of the fundraising campaign at hand. For example, you can set the optimization goal to be to maximize giving potential for major gifts, or to increase giving engagement (of any size) within a particular group of donors. 

FUNdraiser will help you take the first steps to better utilizing data for fundraising. The process is iterative: an initial survey of the data will help identify: 1) strong predictors of giving; 2) areas of growth (weak predictors) for giving; and even 3) areas of improvement for data gathering. 

Results are clearly displayed using state of the art data visualization tools that can be easily understood by all interested parties such as development officers, board members, and CEOs.


## The end.
Our comprehensive fundraising support system also offers one-on-one consulting for how to use these results for annual and long-term planning, large- and small-scale budgeting, and short-term prediction for smaller campaigns and outreach. 

However, many seasoned fundraising professionals will claim that fundraising is an “art and a science,” and while I firmly believe that there’s more science to it than you think, there is still the art of personal outreach and building connections, which drive engagement, which is ultimately reflected in the data. 

It is also important to keep in mind is that just because a particular factor is less of a predictor, or a certain group is less likely to give, this doesn’t mean you should ignore them. In fact, you should question, “Why isn’t this group as likely to give? What can we do to increase that likelihood?” and re-focus efforts on increasing giving in those groups.

Correctly using the insights gathered using FUNdraiser can result in huge financial gains for your university. This allows more students to attend college through the support of financial aid, provides students an enhanced educational experience with increased resources, facilitates success for them in their further education and career, all of which ultimately drive interest and prestige for your university.
