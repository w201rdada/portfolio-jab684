How to Win Customers and Keep ’Em Businesses across industries operate with the goal of building a customer base and retaining those customers. In general, retention requires fewer resources than recruitment, and loyal customers have the potential to be incredibly profitable. My easy-to-use, data-driven application predicts a customer’s likelihood to be loyal, allowing businesses to allocate resources to customers with the greatest loyalty potential. Putting the “Fun” Back in Fundraising Nonprofits, particularly universities, rely heavily on charitable gifts to survive. Prioritizing development efforts is key to maximizing gifts while minimizing the strain on a development department. My software tool, FUNdraiser, goes beyond current approaches that focus primarily on descriptive statistics. It takes advantage of existing data about donors to develop an algorithm that is used to build a predictive model for a particular donor’s (or group of donors’) likelihood to make a charitable donation. About the author Figure .: Me, in a super fancy work headshot Hi! Julia Buffinton here. I’m currently embracing my passion for data as a student in the Master of Information and Data Science program at the University of California, Berkeley. Somehow I find time to do this in addition to my full-time job at a government relations consulting firm, McAllister &amp; Quinn, in downtown Washington, D.C. In my remaining spare time, I also enjoy coordinating alumni relations and development activities as a member of the board of directors for the Cornell Club of Washington and WVBR 93.5 FM in Ithaca, NY.

While both are critical to a business’s success, customer retention is a more efficient and effective way to grow profit. Overall, customers are more likely to spend more money with companies they’ve already done business with1 and customer retention can cost up to seven times less than customer acquisition2. Although the customer and the product/service varies, businesses from many sectors share the goal of improving customer retention rates. Whether it’s a department store serving shoppers, sporting venue serving ticket holders, or consulting firms serving clients, a business can increase customer retention by improving customer services and refining business development efforts. Achieving these can only be done with a thorough understanding of a business’s customers. 1.2 Predicting Loyalty I propose a tool that can be used by research analysts, sales teams, relationship managers, or marketing professionals to identify characteristics of loyal customers to help the business understand how to better serve these customers with the goal of improving customer retention. This tool will examine trends in the characteristics of loyal (and un-loyal) customers to determine which characteristics indicate the likelihood of a customer to renew. Then, based on these characteristics, the tool develops a scoring algorithm indicating how likely a customer is to renew. It can be applied to all customers, highlighting those who are very likely or very unlikely to renew so the business can react accordingly. This tool can also be applied to prospective customers so that sales and business development teams can focus on marketing to types of customers that are more likely to be retained once they are acquired. 1.3 The Sky’s the Limit: Increase Profits with Increased Retention By revealing which customers are more likely to remain loyal, businesses can use this tool to focus on developing their product or service to better serve those customers’ needs. And, by highlighting which customers may be at risk of not renewing, the business can address potential issues to encourage them to renew. As a result, using this solution can dramatically improve customer retention and increase profit. Studies show that increasing customer retention by just 5% can lead to an increase in profit of up to 95%3, so small adjustments can make a large impact. It is important to recognize that achieving a customer retention rate of 100% is nearly impossible, as there may be extenuating circumstances that affect whether a customer renews. However, this tool captures most customers and allows businesses to refocus resources on anomalies if they arise. It can be used to make small changes to improve retention, such as offering incentives for staying or increasing personalized outreach. As time progresses and a business’s product or service develops, characteristics of loyal customers may change, so this tool should be used regularly to inform business development and customer service decisions so a business can continue success for many years. 1.4 Citations 1: https://www.ngdata.com/s/customer-retention-software/ 2: https://www.ngdata.com/what-is-customer-retention/ 3: https://smallbiztrends.com/2014/09/increase-in-customer-retention-increases-profits.html "],

Federal and state government support goes primarily to public universities1, but almost 20%2 of college students attend private universities. These universities must rely more heavily on philanthropy to support project-based endeavors, special interest groups, upgrading/repairing facilities, and most importantly, scholarships to supplement income from tuition and grants. As the need for funding increases, resources to achieve it stagnate. Therefore, fundraising and development team must strive for the perfect balance of minimizing cost to fundraise (personnel, venues, food, goods, etc.) while increasing giving (amount, frequency, and reach). Achieving this lofty goal requires a sophisticated approach to optimizing marketing and outreach campaigns. Luckily, universities collect a lot of data on donors, which is increasingly easier in this day and age, but most don’t know what to do with it. This is where we come in – we can help your university better utilize donor data to increase fundraising capabilities while decreasing cost. 2.2 Philanthropy optimization made easy Our software tool, FUNdraiser, goes beyond current approaches that focus primarily on descriptive statistics and analysis from email marketing, donations, and events. It easily imports existing data about donor demographic information, giving history, and online and in-person engagement. FUNdraiser then develops an algorithm that is used to build a predictive model for a particular donor’s (or group of donors’) likelihood to give. The process is iterative: FUNdraiser integrates with email, donation tracking, and event registration platforms so it can easily gather new data to update its algorithm and identify strong predictors of giving over time. FUNdraiser also allows you to quickly segment data so you can create new campaigns and change the optimization goal with just the click of a button. This way, you can monitor multiple campaigns, from increasing philanthropic engagement by recent alumni to maximizing gifts over $1,000,000. In FUNdraiser, results are clearly displayed using state-of-the-art data visualization tools that can be easily understood by all interested parties, such as development officers, board members, and CEOs. Our comprehensive fundraising support system also offers one-on-one consulting for how to use these results for annual and long-term planning, large- and small-scale budgeting, and short-term prediction for smaller campaigns and outreach. 2.3 To million$ and beyond Correctly using the insights gathered through FUNdraiser can result in huge financial gains for your university. As endowments grow, you can re-invest in students through financial aid or educational initiatives that enhance the learning experience. This ultimately drives interest and prestige for your university so it can develop in the future. One area of growth for FUNdraiser is a feature that show “up and coming” donors – they may not have a high potential to give at the moment, but small changes in outreach or alternative campaigns could drastically increase their potential. Just because a particular factor is currently less of a predictor, or a certain individual is less likely to give, that may change in the future as a result of actions taken. Current tools, including FUNdraiser, are unable to account for this. Personal outreach and building connections drive engagement, which is ultimately reflected in the data. FUNdraiser is most effective when used to inform these interactions, the results of which can be re-introduced to the model to enhance fundraising efforts. 2.4 Bibliography http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2015/06/federal-and-state-funding-of-higher-education https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/the-college-solution/2011/09/06/20-surprising-higher-education-facts "]
