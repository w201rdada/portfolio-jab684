## About the author {-}

Hi! Julia Buffinton here. If you're on this site then you're probably also a MIDS student. But, if not - I'm currently embracing my passion for data as a student in the a Master of Information and Data Science program at the University of California, Berkeley. Somehow I find time to do this in addition to my full time job at a government relations consulting firm, McAllister & Quinn, in downtown Washington, D.C. In my remaining spare time, I also enjoy coordinating alumni relations and development activities as a member of the board of directors for the [Cornell Club of Washington](https://cornellclubdc.org) and [WVBR 93.5 FM](https://wvbr.com) in Ithaca, NY.
