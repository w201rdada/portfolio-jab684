### How to Win Customers and Keep ’Em {-}

Businesses across industries operate with the goal of building a customer base and retaining those customers. In general, retention requires fewer resources than recruitment, and loyal customers have the potential to be incredibly profitable. My easy-to-use, data-driven application predicts a customer's likelihood to be loyal, allowing businesses to allocate resources to customers with the greatest loyalty potential. 

### Putting the “Fun” Back in Fundraising {-}

Nonprofits, particularly universities, rely heavily on charitable gifts to survive. Prioritizing development efforts is key to maximizing gifts while minimizing the strain on a development department. My software tool, FUNdraiser, goes beyond current approaches that focus primarily on descriptive statistics. It takes advantage of existing data about donors to develop an algorithm  that is used to build a predictive model for a particular donor’s (or group of donors’) likelihood to make a charitable donation.

Hi! Julia Buffinton here. I'm currently embracing my passion for data as a student in the Master of Information and Data Science program at the University of California, Berkeley. Somehow I find time to do this in addition to my full-time job at a government relations consulting firm, McAllister & Quinn, in downtown Washington, D.C. In my remaining spare time, I also enjoy coordinating alumni relations and development activities as a member of the board of directors for the [Cornell Club of Washington](https://cornellclubdc.org) and [WVBR 93.5 FM](https://wvbr.com) in Ithaca, NY.
